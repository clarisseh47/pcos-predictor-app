    col1.write ('Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive disorder among women that affects their hormone levels. Women with PCOS struggle with the growth and reproduction of eggs in their ovaries due to their hormonal imbalances. Hormone imbalances impact fertility by making it harder for a woman to get pregnant and making them more prone to a miscarriage. Hormonal imbalances can also cause an irregular menstrual cycle, excess hair growth, and acne.')
